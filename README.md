# Microsoft Software & Systems Academy Project- JUST4KICKZ / Blog
I often found myself looking to learn more about shoes when they were released, and always wanting new updates and possibly purchase shoes if they peaked my interest. After learning about my love for shoes I decided for my project I would take what I learned and make a shoe blog where I would open the floor up to feedback and share what shoes I was following for the week.

## Overall Goal of Application
Web Application where users eager to learn about shoes, future release dates can talk about shoes and all come together. They can have access to several shoes Iâ€™m following on a weekly basis as well as links to these shoes with descriptions.

### Application Walkthrough
- On the "Just4Kickz" home page you can view current shoes that I'm following for the week, click on the shoes and see a short description.

- The "Post Tab" page I will be able to post about trends new updates and release dates *New Feature TBD*

- With the "Feedback Tab" you can input your name, email and a message and submit feedback and select if you would like to receive a follow up.

- The "Shopping Cart Tab" page will provide some quick information on how to purchase shoes either via links or if the shoes are on hand purchase will also be available through me.
